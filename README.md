# Reflected Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (ROU) Process Simulations

This repository contains R code and simulation output demonstrating the behavior of the Reflected Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (ROU) process in one and two dimensions.

## Disclaimer and Attribution

All theoretical concepts, mathematical formulations, and analytical results presented or referenced herein are derived entirely from the original scholarly work by Huang & Pang (2022). This repository does **not** claim authorship or modification of any theoretical contributions, derivations, or results from that work.

> **All credit** for the underlying theory, derivations, and conclusions belongs exclusively to the original authors.

The content in this repository is limited to the development of **independent simulations, visualizations, and code written in R** that reproduce or illustrate selected results and behaviors described in the cited paper. These simulations are intended solely as an academic aid.

## Included Materials

For reference and educational use, a copy of the original manuscript by Huang & Pang (2022) has been included in this repository under fair use guidelines. No changes have been made to the manuscript.

## Purpose

This repository is intended strictly for educational and illustrative purposes. It should not be interpreted as original research, nor as an adaptation, critique, or alternative to the cited work. The simulations serve to support understanding of the ROU process in an academic or instructional setting.
