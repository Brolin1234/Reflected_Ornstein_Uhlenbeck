# Reflected Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (ROU) Process Simulations

This repository contains R code and simulation output illustrating the behavior of the Reflected Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (ROU) process in one and two dimensions.

## Disclaimer and Attribution

All theoretical foundations, equations, and analytical results referenced in this repository are derived directly from the original scholarly work by Huang & Pang (2022). This repository does **not** claim authorship of any original theory or results from that paper.

> **Full credit** for the theoretical development, mathematical formulations, and findings belongs solely to the authors of the original paper.

My contribution is limited to the development of **original simulations and visualizations in R** designed to reproduce, illustrate, and explore the dynamics of the ROU process based on the cited work.

## Included Materials

For completeness and educational purposes, a copy of the original manuscript by Huang & Pang (2022) has been included in this repository under fair use for academic reference.

## Purpose

This repository is for educational and illustrative use only. It is intended to support academic understanding of the ROU process and should not be interpreted as original research or a modification of the authors' original work.
